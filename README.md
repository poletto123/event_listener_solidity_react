# Event Listener

This is a sample of an event listener written with Solidity, ReactJS and using Remix for transaction testing. I have used Ether.js, but the same mechanism was written using web3.js in AppWeb3js.js for comparison reasons. It listens for events emitted from a particular address, with possibility of filtering for a particular destination address.
